# GENESIS
Genesis is an experiment on building a living world, where npc are born, they live, get married, experience some events in their lives, they have children and friends and finally they die. Aimed at building an in-depth background to main story of Oazis game (which will hardly ever happen).

# Language

At this point the generator is available only in Russian (actually it's an artificial language called Hrubrew), and will hardly ever be available in other language.

# Basics

The main concept beind the scene is:

Each character can be either "spawned" or "born" of parents. In the first case he receives a random set of genes, in the second - the genes are determined based on his biological parents' genes.

In future this concept may be extended to include not only intelligent NPC, but also animals and monsters which will be represented by "heart" gene.

Genes are meant to be absolutely independednt, and any "dependence" is governed only by "heart" gene.

Each creature has 2 major specifications:

Gender - which determines whether it is male or female creature

Chirality - a complex scietnific stuff, can be left-chirality or right-chirality. Different chiralities are biologically incompatible (see lore).

And a set of genes, which can be mixed if the hearts are compatible.

The after the characters are convieved, they may experience different events in their lives, which leave facts. Thos might be large-scale (like birthday, marriage, deathday, injury), and down to the tiniest details, like "I've met NPC2 just 5 minutes ago at the square" or "Yestertday I've bought a new shirt for 10 zlotykh".

The next step is making sure the character can tell about those events, describe other characters or objects, tell about his/her feelings.
This is governed by providing the character with Facts, Friends, Character and Values.

Convolution of character's Values and Fact's reference provides attitude towards the event.

Context is a powerful mechanics that enable choosing a specific phrase from a pool of phrases. Context determines current time of the day, relations between characters, mood, knowledge of facts, etc. and provides for best choice of a dialogue phrase or action available in the context.

# Lore

Planet Rorrim is located in Mirror galaxy. It is an Earth-like planet populated with two absolutely non-interacting and biologically incompatible biospheres (left and right chiral). The biological tree ends up in intelligent civilization Felgir consisting of Felc and Girc, intelligent humanoid beings of different chiralities.

Felc (fellaric) are left-chiral cold-blooded creatures. They are lone persons. Either smooth-skinned or covered in scales. Except Serpenta they don't have a tail. Social structure - matriarchate.

Girc (rirraric) are right-chiral warm-blooded social creatures. Most often covered with fur and have a tail. Social structure - patriarchate.

Flower of Fellaric is separated into three petals each separated into three nationalities:

  Petal of Reptila

    Transparenta - they're small and if following a strict diet, their bodies can become highly transparent. Dynamic stealth.

    Talpa - slow and strong chameleons, capable of 3D retranslation of images behind them and walking walls and ceilings. Static stealth.

    Serpenta - poisonous snake-like creatures, who have a long and a strong tail, which can be used to jump or to attack enemies.

  Petal of Ornita

    Aspecta - have extremely sharp sight, but are incapable of speech.

    Arachna - are masters of manipulation and hypnosis, thou hated by everybody else because of that.

    Glacia - hypothetical third nationality of Ornita, living only in legends.

  Petal of Aqua

    Amphibia - fish-like creatures, capable of holding breath for enormous amounts of time and feeling ok in cold water. The only Aqua nationality survived up to present.

    Ichta - extinct approximately 3000 years ago.

    Electra - extinct approximately 3000 years ago.    

Flower of Girraric is also separated into three petals each of three nationalities:

  Petal of Canina

    Socia - are extemely beautiful and talkative, loved by both felc and girc.

    Venada - have extremely acute senses and orientation skills. They're also psychology experts.

    Norda - can sustain extemely low temperatures, are stronger and taller than any other nationalities of felc and girc.

  Petal of Felina

    Nocta - stealthy creatures of the night, good thiefs and assasins, very agile and dexterous.

    Mediana - average in all means.

    Magmata - hypothetical third nationality of Felina. Speculated to be remnants of creatures recently discovered in lava caves after a volcano eruption.

  Raccoona

    Scienta - extremely intelligent, have tendency to math sciences.

    Vitana - have very acute perception, making them capable of medical sciences and even foreseeing future.

    Somnia - are lost-minded dreamers and romancers.

The Protagonist finds himself stranded in a huge icy desert near the North Pole of Rorrim due to a plane crash, surrounded by inaccessible mountains, whith him/her being lone survivor. There are 8 Oazises - huge geothermally warmed areas featuring large cities, forests and fields and a multitude of smaller Splashes or Hot-Spots usually large enough to sustain life for a few inhabitants. Polar day, aurora borealis, deadly cold mixed with hot ground, there's much to explore both above the ground and below, travel to unreachable places, and, maybe, decide the destiny of the whole felgir civilization...
